# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security issue (e.g., a way to bypass the Application Access Policy or leak credentials in a Runbook log), please report it to Microsoft.

You can report vulnerabilities by using this [link](https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability/new)

Any code related issues can be emailed directly to myself via this email: [AlexB1f359@proton.me](mailto:AlexB1f359@proton.me)
